## Run as an Event
~~To use this plugin as an event you must first install the base plugin and additionally must also install the DeathmatchEvent plugin in /"where you installed cedmod"/CedModEvents. See the [Releases](https://github.com/brayden-dowson/Deathmatch/releases) to get the DeathmatchEvent plugin. You must have Cedmod installed if you want to run the plugin as an event. If you have not installed Cedmod you can get it here [Cedmod](https://github.com/CedModV2/CedMod)~~ **I am not planning to provide support for the Cedmod version**
